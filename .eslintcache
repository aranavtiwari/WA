While it is standard practice for a Group of Seven host to invite guest countries, their involvement through the process is typically limited, but according to a person familiar with Johnson’s plans, the guests’ participation this year will be deeper than usual.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>‘Open Societies Charter’</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was during a virtual meeting of the group’s political directors on Jan. 22, that the U.K. told the other six members it was planning to ask the three countries to attend parts of a foreign and development ministers’ meeting, and have the G-7 sign an “Open Societies Charter” with them. Japan pushed back despite reassurances that Britain doesn’t want to expand or dilute the G-7, according to the cable. U.K. Foreign Minister Dominic Raab is hoping to hold the meeting in person May 3-6 in Wales.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe idea of expanding the G-7 was floated by Trump last year. In addition to Australia, South Korea and India, he proposed re-inviting Russia, which was ejected after the annexation of Crimea.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src={imgtwo} className=\"img\" />\r\n\r\n<p>President Joe Biden hasn’t indicated where he stands on the issue but has said he wants to convene a summit of democracies. And prominent voices in both the U.K. and the U.S. have continued to call for the group to open its doors to new members.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nFor Japan though, South Korea’s participation is awkward given renewed tensions stemming from its 1910-1945 colonial rule over the Korean Peninsula, and it doesn’t want to see membership or a privileged status extended to Australia and India, in particular, either -- European G-7 diplomats said Japan’s objections are in part likely because it wants to be the only Asian country in the forum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.K’s other plans have been mostly welcomed by the rest of the group as an opportunity to repair and reinvigorate the G-7, and multilateralism more generally, after what the cable describes as a “dysfunctional” 2020. Under the U.S. presidency, the group failed to offer a collective response to the coronavirus pandemic, was embroiled in transatlantic spats over China and managed to produce only two joint statements.<br/><br/>\r\nThe U.K’s other plans have been mostly welcomed by the rest of the group as an opportunity to repair and reinvigorate the G-7, and multilateralism more generally, after what the cable describes as a “dysfunctional” 2020.
