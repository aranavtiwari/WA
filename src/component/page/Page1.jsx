and the founder of the Anti-Corruption Foundation

In December 2016, Navalny tried to run for President

Russia's Central Electoral Commission and later the
Supreme Court of Russia due to a criminal conviction.
            </p>
 <p>On 20 August 2020, Navalny was hospitalized in
serious condition after he was poisoned with a
nerve agent during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow.<br/>

have refused to open a criminal investigation into
the matter.</p>

        <h2>A PALACE FOR PUTIN: THE STORY OF THE BIGGEST BRIBE</h2>
        <p>A Palace for Putin: The Story of the Biggest Bribe<br/><br/>

a 2021 Russian documentary film by the Russian non-profit
Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) detailing alleged
corruption by Vladimir Putin, the current President of Russia,
over the building of the Residence at Cape Idokopas. The film
estimates that the complex, located near the town of
Gelendzhik in Krasnodar Krai, which it says was built for
Putin, cost over ₽100 billion (approximately $1.35 billion).</p>
<p>The film opens with a call for people to come
out and participate in the 2021 Russian protests
demanding the release of Alexei Navalny, the
film's narrator and scriptwriter, who was
detained after arriving in Russia following
treatment and rehabilitation in Germany in
connection with his poisoning in 2020.</p>
<h3>PUTIN’S DEFENCE</h3>
<p>On the day the documentary film was published,
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Putin
did not have any palaces.<br/>
The next day, he called the film a "pseudo-
investigation" and a "scam" to reporters, saying that
citizens should "think before transferring money to
such crooks".</p>
