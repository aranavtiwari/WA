            <h1>Multi-modal Logistic Park</h1>
            <h4>The country's largest multi-modal logistics park at Sanand with an estimated investment of Rs 50,000 crore.</h4>
        <p>Developing 35 Multi-modal Logistic Parks (MMLPs) in the country<br/><br/>

Multi-Modal Logistics Parks (MMLPs) are a key policy initiative of the
Government of India to improve the country's logistics sector by lowering
overall freight costs, reducing vehicular pollution and congestion, and cutting

warehousing costs.</p>
<h2>TO BE BUILT</h2>
<p>Cities like Vijayawada, Chennai, Nagpur,
Bengaluru, Surat, Hyderabad and Gauhati are
selected among others. Six cities of Gujarat are
selected, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Bharuch,
Valsad and Kandla, where these projects will be
set up on a Public Private Partnership (PPP)
model.</p>
<h2>MULTI-MODAL LOGISTICS PARKS IN INDIA</h2>
<p>The government's Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
(MoRTH) is developing multi-modal logistics parks at selected
locations in the country under its Logistics Efficiency
Enhancement Program (LEEP).<br/>
India is burdened with high logistics costs, which account for
about 13% of the value of goods sold in the economy compared
with 8% in other major economies. The average cost to
export/import one container in India is about 72% higher than
in China.</p>
<h3>WORLD BANK INDEX</h3>
<p>Logistics Performance Index - an interactive
benchmarking tool created by the World Bank to
help countries identify the challenges and
opportunities they face in their performance on
trade logistics and what they can do to improve
their performance.
The Logistics Performance Index is reported by the
World Bank in every two years.</p>

<h2>MMLP IN INDIA</h2>
<p>The government defines an MMLP as a freight-
handling facility encompassing a minimum area of
100 acres (40.5 hectares), with various modes of
transport access, and comprising mechanized
warehouses, specialized storage solutions such as
cold storage, facilities for mechanized material
handling and inter-modal transfer container
terminals, and bulk and break-bulk cargo terminals.</p>

<h2>GUJARAT MMLP</h2>
<p>The proposed 1,450 acre park will have a
dedicated air cargo complex with 4.6 km long
runway to handle even large sized cargo aircraft
and will offer direct air, rail and road connectivity.<br/>

It will also have a provision of direct rail

connectivity with dedicated freight corridor which
is part of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor

(DMIC).</p>
