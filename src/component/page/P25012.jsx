            <h1>AKASH NG Test Fired for the First time by DRDO</h1>
            <h4>Akash-NG is a new generation Surface-to-Air Missile meant for use by the Indian Air Force with an aim of intercepting high manoeuvring aerial threats, says DRDO.</h4>
        <p>New Delhi: In a boost to Indian Air Force (IAF) defence system, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on Monday successfully test-fired surface-to-air Akash-NG (New Generation) Missile than can intercept high manoeuvring aerial threats. <br/><br/>

"DRDO conducted successful maiden launch of Akash-NG (New Generation) Missile from Integrated Test Range off the coast of Odisha today. Akash-NG is a new generation Surface-to-Air Missile meant for use by IAF with an aim of intercepting high manoeuvring aerial threats, the DRDO said in a statement.<br/><br/>

It further stated that the missile intercepted the target with textbook precision and the launch met all test objectives by performing high manoeuvres during the trajectory. "Performance of the Command and Control system, onboard avionics and aerodynamic configuration of the missile was successfully validated," it added.<br/><br/>

The missile launch came on the eve of Republic Day celebrations in the country.</p>

<h2>WHY INDIA BUYING S-400 WHEN WE HAVE AKASH?</h2>
<p>Akash: Is actually a medium range SAM. It is optimised to provide air defence to armoured corps.</p>
       <ul>
            <li><p>Operational range of akash varients</p></li>
           <li><p><i>25 - 30 km (19 mi) (Akash Mk.1/1S)</i></p></li>
           <li><p><i>40 km (25 mi) (Akash Mk.2)</i></p></li>
           <li><p><i>50 - 80 km (Akash NG) (under development)</i></p></li>
           <li><p>S-400 has a much larger range</p></li>

<p><i>The Union Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra
Modi, on December 30 gave its go-ahead to the sale of Akash
surface-to-air missile systems to friendly foreign countries
and created a high-powered panel for swifter approval to
export of military hardware at a time India has set a target of

clocking defence exports worth $5 billion by 2024.<br/><br/>

The missile --- already in service in the Indian military --- has
an indigenous content of 96%. The missile was inducted into
the Indian Air Force in 2014 and in the army a year later.</i></p>
