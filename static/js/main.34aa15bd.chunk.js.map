President-elect Joe Biden has nominated him as his defence secretary.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“I would further operationalise India’s ‘major defence partner’ status and continue to build upon existing strong defence cooperation to ensure the US and Indian militaries can collaborate to address shared interests,” Austin said in response to a question submitted before his confirmation hearing.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nHe said he would also seek to deepen and broaden the defence cooperation between India and the US through the Quad security dialogue and other regional multilateral engagements.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nAustin said his understanding is that Pakistan has taken constructive steps to meet US requests in support of the Afghanistan peace process. Pakistan has also taken steps against anti-Indian groups, such as Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, although this progress is incomplete, he said.</p>\r\n<p>Many factors in addition to the security assistance suspension may impact Pakistan’s cooperation, including Afghanistan negotiations and the dangerous escalation following the Pulwama terrorist attack, Austin said. President Donald Trump had suspended all the financial and security aid to Pakistan in 2018 citing lack of cooperation from Islamabad in the fight against terrorism</p>\r\n<p>If confirmed, Austin said he will press Pakistan to prevent its territory from being used as a sanctuary for militants and violent extremist organisations. Continuing to build relationships with Pakistan’s military will provide openings for the United States and Pakistan to cooperate on key issues, he said.</p>\r\n<p>Austin said he will focus on the shared interests which include training future Pakistan military leaders through the use of International Military Education and Training funds. Pakistan will play an important role in any political settlement in Afghanistan. “We also need to work with Pakistan to defeat al-Qaeda and the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISIS-K) and to enhance regional stability,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>Observing that Pakistan is an essential partner in any peace process in Afghanistan, Austin said that if confirmed, he will encourage a regional approach that garners support from neighbours like Pakistan, while also deterring regional actors from serving as spoilers to the Afghanistan peace process.</p>\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <div className=\"back\">\r\n            <a href=\"/WA/\">&#8592; Back</a>\r\n        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default P2001\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\nimport Home from '../Home';\r\n\r\nfunction Page1(props) {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"page\">\r\n            <h1>Russia Protests 2021</h1>\r\n\r\n            <h4>Putin fears Alexei Navalny Explained Putin's palac</h4>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"page-para\">\r\n            Russia is predominantly a seller of hydrocarbons Since the crude oil price crash and the fall in\r\nnatural gas price, Russia has been unable to earn a lot of revenue Above all that the U.S sanctions have made matters worse\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            In 2019, according to the Corruption Perceptions Index reported by Transparency\r\nInternational, Russia ranked in 137th out of 180 countries, and is the most corrupt European nation.  \r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <h3>ALEXEI NAVALNY</h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n            A Russian opposition leader, politician, lawyer and anti-\r\n            corruption activist.<br/>\r\nNavalny is a Russian Opposition Coordination Council\r\nmember, the leader of the Russia of the Future party\r\nand the founder of the Anti-Corruption Foundation\r\n(FBK).<br/>\r\n\r\nIn December 2016, Navalny tried to run for President\r\nof Russia during the 2018 election but was barred by\r\nRussia's Central Electoral Commission and later the\r\nSupreme Court of Russia due to a criminal conviction.\r\n            </p>\r\n <p>On 20 August 2020, Navalny was hospitalized in\r\nserious condition after he was poisoned with a\r\nnerve agent during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow.<br/>\r\nHe was medically evacuated to Berlin and\r\ndischarged on 22 September.
