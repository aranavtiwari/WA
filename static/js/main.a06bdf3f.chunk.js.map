President-elect Joe Biden has nominated him as his defence secretary.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“I would further operationalise India’s ‘major defence partner’ status and continue to build upon existing strong defence cooperation to ensure the US and Indian militaries can collaborate to address shared interests,” Austin said in response to a question submitted before his confirmation hearing.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nHe said he would also seek to deepen and broaden the defence cooperation between India and the US through the Quad security dialogue and other regional multilateral engagements.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nAustin said his understanding is that Pakistan has taken constructive steps to meet US requests in support of the Afghanistan peace process. Pakistan has also taken steps against anti-Indian groups, such as Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, although this progress is incomplete, he said.</p>\r\n<p>Many factors in addition to the security assistance suspension may impact Pakistan’s cooperation, including Afghanistan negotiations and the dangerous escalation following the Pulwama terrorist attack, Austin said. President Donald Trump had suspended all the financial and security aid to Pakistan in 2018 citing lack of cooperation from Islamabad in the fight against terrorism</p>\r\n<p>If confirmed, Austin said he will press Pakistan to prevent its territory from being used as a sanctuary for militants and violent extremist organisations. Continuing to build relationships with Pakistan’s military will provide openings for the United States and Pakistan to cooperate on key issues, he said.</p>\r\n<p>Austin said he will focus on the shared interests which include training future Pakistan military leaders through the use of International Military Education and Training funds. Pakistan will play an important role in any political settlement in Afghanistan. “We also need to work with Pakistan to defeat al-Qaeda and the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISIS-K) and to enhance regional stability,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>Observing that Pakistan is an essential partner in any peace process in Afghanistan, Austin said that if confirmed, he will encourage a regional approach that garners support from neighbours like Pakistan, while also deterring regional actors from serving as spoilers to the Afghanistan peace process.</p>\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <div className=\"back\">\r\n        <Link to=\"/\">&#8592; Back</Link>\r\n        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default P2001\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\nimport Home from '../Home';\r\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\r\nfunction Page1(props) {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"page\">\r\n            <h1>Russia Protests 2021</h1>\r\n\r\n            <h4>Putin fears Alexei Navalny Explained Putin's palac</h4>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"page-para\">\r\n            Russia is predominantly a seller of hydrocarbons Since the crude oil price crash and the fall in\r\nnatural gas price, Russia has been unable to earn a lot of revenue Above all that the U.S sanctions have made matters worse\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            In 2019, according to the Corruption Perceptions Index reported by Transparency\r\nInternational, Russia ranked in 137th out of 180 countries, and is the most corrupt European nation.  \r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <h3>ALEXEI NAVALNY</h3>\r\n            <p>\r\n            A Russian opposition leader, politician, lawyer and anti-\r\n            corruption activist.<br/>\r\nNavalny is a Russian Opposition Coordination Council\r\nmember, the leader of the Russia of the Future party\r\nand the founder of the Anti-Corruption Foundation\r\n(FBK).<br/>\r\n\r\nIn December 2016, Navalny tried to run for President\r\nof Russia during the 2018 election but was barred by\r\nRussia's Central Electoral Commission and later the\r\nSupreme Court of Russia due to a criminal conviction.\r\n            </p>\r\n <p>On 20 August 2020, Navalny was hospitalized in\r\nserious condition after he was poisoned with a\r\nnerve agent during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow.<br/>\r\nHe was medically evacuated to Berlin and\r\ndischarged on 22 September.

While it is standard practice for a Group of Seven host to invite guest countries, their involvement through the process is typically limited, but according to a person familiar with Johnson’s plans, the guests’ participation this year will be deeper than usual.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>‘Open Societies Charter’</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was during a virtual meeting of the group’s political directors on Jan. 22, that the U.K. told the other six members it was planning to ask the three countries to attend parts of a foreign and development ministers’ meeting, and have the G-7 sign an “Open Societies Charter” with them. Japan pushed back despite reassurances that Britain doesn’t want to expand or dilute the G-7, according to the cable. U.K. Foreign Minister Dominic Raab is hoping to hold the meeting in person May 3-6 in Wales.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe idea of expanding the G-7 was floated by Trump last year.

But the arms sales in question are historic: they would represent the most advanced and most classified American weapons systems ever sold to Arab allies. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn the past, lethal drones and the flagship F-35 joint strike fighter jet were off the table for Arab allies in the Middle East because of Washington’s commitment to maintaining Israel’s advantageous qualitative military edge, or QME, in the region — a policy that has been codified in U.S. law for decades. But since the signing of the Abraham Accords in August normalizing relations between the UAE and Israel, acquiring these systems became a real possibility for the Emiratis. </p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is still not the case with Saudi Arabia, which has not normalized relations with Israel, but its pending purchase in the broader arms deal includes billions of dollars’ worth of precision-guided munitions.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nAnalysts interviewed by CNBC note that while Washington’s relationship with the UAE isn’t likely to see significant changes, the one with the Saudis probably will. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“It’s not going to be everybody gets to do whatever they want. The relationship is going to go back to strategic and values-based, which we haven’t done in four years,” a former senior Obama administration official familiar with Biden’s thinking told CNBC.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“It’s not going to be a good relationship between the U.S. and Saudi without some significant changes,” the former official said, speaking anonymously due to professional restrictions. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe relationship with the kingdom during former President Donald Trump’s tenure has been described by many observers as “permissive.” The White House did not pursue penalties against Riyadh for its role, as reported by U.S. intelligence agencies, in the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018. It also made little mention of its widely reported human rights abuses, which include jailing and allegedly torturing several female Saudi activists.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nWhen a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers voted to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, Trump vetoed them. And in May of 2019, Trump declared a “national emergency” over tensions with Iran in order to bypass congressional approval procedures to push through an $8 billion weapons sale to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Jordan.   <br/><br/>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>‘Change your behavior’</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThings are going to be different now, according to the former official. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“He (Biden) doesn’t want a negative relationship with Saudi Arabia, he wants them to pay the price. Change your behavior,” he said. “At the end of the day we hold the cards, not them.” <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIndeed, Biden in an early 2020 presidential debate promised to make Saudi Arabia “the pariah that they are.”<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe Saudi Foreign Ministry and the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not respond to CNBC’s requests for comment on the weapons sale pause or Biden’s “pariah” comment.  <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nRiyadh congratulated Biden on his presidential win, but not until more than 24 hours had passed since his victory was declared.  <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nJessica Leyland, a senior intelligence analyst at London-based risk consultancy firm AKE International, underlined the changes Biden is expected to bring in. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“President Trump proved a steadfast partner to Mohammed bin Salman, but the Crown Prince now faces a Biden administration which will judge the Kingdom on its human rights record, the conflict in Yemen and MbS’s arbitrary detentions of princes,” she wrote in a report released on Sunday.    <br/><br/>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn addition to the Biden administration’s new apparent focus on values, the current pause in weapons sales also has a crucial security angle, says Bradley Bowman, the senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.  <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“There are some things to balance here from an American perspective. We don’t want the most advanced fighter in the world, and the technologies associated with it, to be leaking to Beijing or Moscow,” he told CNBC’s “Capital Connection” on Tuesday.   <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBut he stressed the divergence between Washington’s relationships with the UAE and with Saudi Arabia.  <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“I think robust arms sales will continue to the UAE, we’ll have to watch the F-35 closely — but I think Saudi Arabia is in for some real tough sledding, particularly because of their activities in Yemen,” he said. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe UAE’s embassy to the U.S. on Wednesday conveyed on Twitter that they fully expected the pause. “As in previous administrations, the UAE anticipated a review of current policies by the new administration,” it wrote.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<div className=\"back\">\r\n<Link to=\"/\">&#8592; Back</Link>\r\n        </div>\r\n</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default P2901\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/P3001.5ed55ee3.jpg\";","import React from 'react'\r\nimport img from '../../img/P3001.jpg'\r\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom'\r\n\r\nfunction P3001() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"page\">\r\n            <h1>China warns Taiwan independence 'means war' as US pledges support</h1>\r\n            <img src={img} alt=\"\" className=\"img\"/>\r\n            <h4>China has warned Taiwan that any attempt to seek independence \"means war\".</h4>\r\n            <p>The warning comes days after China stepped up its military activities and flew warplanes near the island.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIt also comes after new US President Joe Biden reaffirmed his commitment to Taiwan, and set out his stance in Asia.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe US has called China's latest warning \"unfortunate\", adding that tensions did not need to lead to \"anything like confrontation\".<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nChina sees democratic Taiwan as a breakaway province, but Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, with its own constitution, military, and elected leaders.</p>\r\n        \r\n        <p>\r\n        Analysts say Beijing is becoming increasingly concerned that Taiwan's government is moving the island towards a formal declaration of independence and it wants to warn President Tsai Ing-wen against taking steps in that direction.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nPresident Tsai, however, has repeatedly said that Taiwan is already an independent state, making any formal declaration unnecessary.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, Chinese defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian defended the recent military activities near Taiwan, saying they were \"necessary actions to address the current security situation in the Taiwan Strait and to safeguard national sovereignty and security\".<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\"They are a solemn response to external interference and provocations by 'Taiwan independence' forces,\" he added.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\"We warn those 'Taiwan independence' elements - those who play with fire will burn themselves, and Taiwan independence means war.\"<br/><br/>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h3>China and Taiwan: The basics</h3>\r\n        <p>China and Taiwan have had separate governments since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Beijing has long tried to limit Taiwan's international activities and both have vied for influence in the Pacific region<br/><br/>\r\nTensions have increased in recent years and Beijing has not ruled out the use of force to take the island back<br/><br/>\r\nAlthough Taiwan is officially recognised by only a handful of nations, its democratically elected government has strong commercial and informal links with many countries<br/><br/>\r\nLike most nations, the US has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but a US law does require it to provide the island with the means to defend itself</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Blunt threat should be taken seriously</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nChina's official spokespeople try not to talk about war. They almost always emphasise that theirs is a peace-loving country.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nChina is not a nation with a history of expeditionary military confrontation far beyond what it regards as its borders.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nHowever, under Xi Jinping's leadership, China has repeatedly said that it would use military force to prevent any move towards formal independence by Taiwan, which it regards as a renegade province.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThreatening a war isn't as nuanced as talk of military intervention. It's blunt, more frightening. It is different too. Military intervention could come in a multitude of ways; not necessarily an out-and-out war between two competing sides and their allies.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBut Taiwan's status is a red line for Beijing, a part of what it regards as its unimpeachable territorial integrity. An \"internal affair\", alongside Hong Kong.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe language deployed by the government spokespeople may not always be this provocative but when it comes to Taiwan it's fair to assume this is what China is, ultimately, willing to resort to.<br/><br/>\r\n</p>\r\n        \r\n<div className=\"back\">\r\n<Link to=\"/\">&#8592; Back</Link>\r\n        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default P3001\r\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/P3101.22a7b1da.webp\";","import React from 'react'\r\nimport img from '../../img/P3101.webp'\r\nimport {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\r\nfunction P3101() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"page\">\r\n            <h1>IAF to focus on ₹1.3 lakh crore deal for 114 fighter jets</h1>\r\n            <img src={img} alt=\"\" className=\"img\"/>\r\n            <h4>Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria had termed the Rafale as one of the strong contenders for the 114 fighter acquisition project.</h4>\r\n            <p>\r\n            With the deal for 83 LCA Tejas Mark 1A aircraft set to be signed during upcoming Aero India, the Indian Air Force is now looking to focus on the multirole fighter aircraft project under which it is planning to acquire 114 combat aircraft expected to cost over ₹1.3 lakh crore.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>The Air Force had been undertaking one fighter aircraft project at a time and now its 83 LCA Mark 1A fighters have been cleared by the Cabinet Committee on Security led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ₹50,000 crore deal is set to be signed in Bengaluru during Aero India.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\"The 83 LCA Tejas would be replacing the four squadrons of the MiG-21 fighter jets which are set to be phased out in near future. The focus would now be on the 114 fighter jets project,\" government sources told ANI.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe IAF has already issued the Request for Information for the tender and would be soon moving a proposal for getting the Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) before the Defence Ministry for the multi-billion dollar project which would enable it to acquire 4.5 plus generation aircraft in large numbers to match the capabilities of the omni role Rafale fighters 36 of which have started getting inducted from last year.</p>\r\n        <p>\r\n        The Request for Information (RFI) has been responded to by several global players including fighter jet manufacturers from the US, France, Russia and Sweden.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nWhile the Americans are offering from the F-15 Strike Eagle, F-18 Super Hornet and an F-16 variant by the name of F-21, the Russians are likely to offer the MiG-35 and a Sukhoi fighter. Sweden's Saab is looking to pitch in with its Gripen fighter aircraft which it says is far more advanced than the one which was offered in 2007 to the Indian Air Force. France would be participating in the tender with the Rafale fighter jets.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nRecently, Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria had termed the Rafale as one of the strong contenders for the 114 fighter acquisition project.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Sources said that for selection in the project, the main aspects would be the capabilities of the aircraft on offer along with the price at which it is offered. The Indian Air Force is also developing the parameters on which it will select the fighters which would be both single-engine and double-engine and would create a level-playing field for them in the competition.</p>\r\n        <p>The 114 aircraft would also be Made in India and the foreign firms would be required to do a transfer of technology to the Indian partner as part of government's initiative to create a strong domestic defence industry under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat scheme.\r\n\r\nLagging behind the neighbours in terms of fighter aircraft inductions, the Indian Air Force has got deals for 119 of them in the last four years. While in September 2016, it signed a deal for 36 Rafale fighters, it would be signing the deal with a Public Sector Undertaking in next few days for 83 LCA Mark 1A Tejas fighters. In recent times, it has also operationalised two squadrons of the LCA Tejas mark 1.</p>\r\n        \r\n<div className=\"back\">\r\n<Link to=\"/\">&#8592; Back</Link>\r\n        </div>\r\n        \r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default P3101\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\nimport {Link, Route, Switch} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nimport Home from './Home';\r\nimport About from './About';\r\nimport Quotes from './Quotes';\r\nimport P2001 from \"./page/P2001\";\r\nimport T241 from \"./page/Page1\";\r\nimport P2412 from \"./page/P2412\";\r\nimport P2301 from \"./page/P2301\";\r\nimport P23012 from \"./page/P23012\";\r\nimport P2501 from \"./page/P2501\";\r\nimport P25012 from \"./page/P25012\";\r\nimport P2601 from \"./page/P2601\";\r\nimport P26012 from \"./page/P26012\";\r\nimport P2701 from \"./page/P2701\";\r\nimport P2801 from \"./page/P2801\";\r\nimport P3001 from \"./page/P3001\";\r\nimport P3101 from \"./page/P3101\";\r\nimport '../App.css';\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n\r\n\r\n    const pages = [\r\n        {path:\"/\",component:Home},\r\n        {path:\"/about\",component:About},\r\n        {path:\"/qutoes\",component:Quotes},\r\n        {path:\"/P2001\",component:P2001},\r\n        {path:\"/T241\",component:T241},\r\n        {path:\"/P2412\",component:P2412},\r\n        {path:\"/P2301\",component:P2301},\r\n        {path:\"/P23012\",component:P23012},\r\n        {path:\"/P2501\",component:P2501},\r\n        {path:\"/P25012\",component:P25012},\r\n        {path:\"/P2601\",component:P2601},\r\n        {path:\"/P26012\",component:P26012},\r\n        {path:\"/P2701\",component:P2701},\r\n        {path:\"/P2801\",component:P2801},\r\n        {path:\"/P3001\",component:P3001},\r\n        {path:\"/P3101\",component:P3101}\r\n\r\n\r\n    ]\r\n    \r\n    const pageLink = () => {\r\n        return pages.map((data) =>{\r\n            return(\r\n                <Link path={data.path} exact component={data.component} />\r\n            )\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <Switch>\r\n                {pageLink()}\r\n            </Switch>\r\n        </div>\r\n)\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\nimport{NavLink} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction Nav() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className='nav'>\r\n            <div className=\"nav-bar\">\r\n                <NavLink to=\"/\" activeClassName='logo'>WA.</NavLink>\r\n                <div className=\"nav-right\">\r\n                <NavLink to=\"/qutoes\" className=\"about\">Qutoes</NavLink>\r\n                <NavLink to=\"/about\"  className='about'>About Us</NavLink>\r\n                </div>\r\n                \r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Nav\r\n","import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nfunction Footer() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div style={{marginTop:\"6rem\"}}>\r\n            <p style={{color:\"#728aa2\"}}>Made with React and SASS</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Footer\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\r\nimport {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nimport App from './component/App'\r\nimport Nav from './component/Nav';\r\nimport Footer from \"./component/Footer\";\r\nimport './App.css';\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n    <BrowserRouter basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}>\r\n        <Nav/>\r\n        <App/>\r\n        <Footer/>\r\n    </BrowserRouter>,\r\n\r\n    document.querySelector('#root')\r\n)"],"sourceRoot":""}
